            <h1>The Bear and Two Friends</h1>

            <p>One day two friends were passing through a jungle. Out of a sudden, a bear appeared. One of the two
                friends quickly climbed the tree nearby. But the second friend did not know how to Climb a Tree. He was
                startled.</p>

            <p>The bear slowly approached him. But suddenly, he remembered that the bear did not touch the dead bodies.
                He lay down breathless and closed his eyes. The beer started to sniff around him and left the place.
                Then the first friend came down and asked the second friend what the bear had whispered to his ears. The
                second friend said the beer advised him not to make friends with selfish people post.</p>

            <h2>Moral</h2>

            <p>if your friend leaves you in the middle of trouble, he is not your true friend. A friend in need is a
                friend indeed.
            </p>
